            alt="Cloud Provi" id="image-left">
        <p class="justify">Cloud provisioning refers to the processes for the deployment and integration of cloud
            computing services within an enterprise IT infrastructure. This is a broad term that incorporates the
            policies, procedures and an enterprise’s objective in sourcing cloud services and solutions from a cloud
            service provider.</p>
        <p class="justify">Cloud provisioning is the dynamic allocation of a cloud provider's resources to a customer.
            The resources include compute, storage, and networking services on-demand.
            The process is an elementary part of most modern IT infrastructures that allows responsive deployment and
            scaling. Provisioning happens through self-service portals or through automated tools.</p>

            </b>
            <p class="justify">This detailed document, often crafted through careful contract drafting, serves as the
                bedrock of the partnership, clearly defining the responsibilities of both parties and establishing
                mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing service guarantees. The cloud service provider then provisions
                the promised resources, including storage, processing power (CPU), RAM, and GPU (for graphic-intensive
                workloads).</p>
            <b>
                <li>Dynamic Cloud Provisioning</li>
            </b>
            <p class="justify">Dynamic provisioning, also known as on-demand provisioning, is the most flexible and
                scalable cloud computing model that dynamically allows cloud service providers to allocate resources as
                needed. In this model, the client organization can quickly acquire required IT resources based on their
                dynamic requirements without making manual adjustments. Cloud automation and orchestration allow service
                providers to streamline the dynamic provisioning process and address varying customer needs. It ensures
                that the resources are instantly available whenever required.</p>

                <li>User Cloud Provisioning</li>
            </b>
            <p class="justify">User self-provisioning, also known as cloud self-service, enables customers to subscribe
                for the required resources directly from the cloud provider through a website. Customers have to create
                a user account and pay for the required resources.</p>

        <b>
            <li>Automation & Orchestration:</li>
        </b>
        <p class="justify">Cloud automation involves streamlining repetitive and manual workloads. Cloud orchestration
            is the systematic organization and coordination of automated workflows in the cloud to streamline repetitive
            tasks. Orchestration is fundamentally essential in inter-connected and complex multi-cloud ecosystems.</p>
        <b>
            <li>Scalability:</li>
        </b>
        <p class="justify">Cloud scalability is mainly based on two types; vertical and horizontal.
            Vertical Scaling (scaling up or down) is the addition or removal of resources, such as memory (RAM), storage
            (Capacity), or processing power (CPU), to an existing cloud server, with a maximum limit based on the total
            resources of the cloud. It usually involves downtime if scaling reaches over the limit.</p>
        <b>
            <li>Security:</li>
        </b>
        <p class="justify">Security is the central area in cloud provisioning, involving several security and scrutiny
            measures like access control, multi-factor authentication, data encryption, threat intelligence, and
            monitoring. Cloud providers also need to formulate a robust disaster recovery plan to ensure the continuity
            of services and data security.</p>
